Android Calculator App
This project was developed as a course assignment for the Mobile Applications course during the fourth year of my Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering.

Overview
A simple Android calculator built using Java in Android Studio. The application performs the four basic arithmetic operations:

Addition

Subtraction

Multiplication

Division

Unique Feature
In addition to standard calculations, the app includes a custom graphical feature as part of the assignment requirements.

ðŸŸ© Custom Drawing Functionality
When given an expression in the form of a + b (where b > a), the app will:

Draw a rectangle centered in the app window

Inside the rectangle, it will draw a bordeaux-colored circle

The circle will have a diameter equal to a

The rectangle dimensions are based on the values of a and b

This feature demonstrates custom rendering and UI interaction beyond standard calculator functionality.
